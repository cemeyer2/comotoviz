This document is for developers just joining
the Lobo project.

Welcome. For the benefit of those who come after
you, please modify this document if you find
inaccuracies or if you feel that clarification
is needed.

PROJECT STRUCTURE
-----------------

IzPack_RegistryPanel: Subproject containing an
IzPack panel extension that registers .xamj and
.htln file associations in Windows. (Depends on
the IzPack externals.)

XAMJ_Build: Subproject containing the Ant build
script that builds the Warrior installer. (Depends
on all other subprojects.)

Platform_Core: The browser core. This contains
the request engine, FramePanel, the browser
window infrastructure and other core features.

Primary_Extension: The primary browser extension.
This contains most of the browser GUI, in addition
to a Cobra implementation.

HTML_Renderer: This is the Cobra project.

FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND
-----------------------

The Platform_Core project contains the following
points of interest:

- org/lobobrowser/main/EntryPoint.java
  Entry point of the Lobo browser. If started
  via this class, a program may simply find an existing
  Lobo instance.

The HTML_Renderer project is essentially the same
as Cobra. Some points of interest there are:

- org/lobobrowser/html/renderer/RBlockViewport.java
  This is basically in charge of laying out HTML
  blocks.
