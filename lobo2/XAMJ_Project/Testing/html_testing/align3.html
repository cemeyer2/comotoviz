The Cobra HTML Toolkit is an open source library that provides a pure Java HTML parser and a renderer.

XAMJ is an XML UI and text markup language tightly integraded with Java. XAMJ applications/pages may be deployed over HTTP (like HTML or Java Webstart) or locally on a user's PC. We have an open-source browser/platform for the deployment of XAMJ content, named Warrior (download), itself written in XAMJ.
<table border=1 align="right"><tr><td>table # 2</td></tr></table>
The Warrior platform can currently be used (1) to deploy XAMJ apps over HTTP similarly to Java Webstart, (2) to launch standalone XAMJ apps, (3) as an XML UI API, and (4) as a browser for new content types, including other Java-based XML UI languages.

XAMJ allows embedding Java code in several types of scriptlets, much like JSP, except on the client side (with security restrictions.) That is, a XAMJ document is translated into a Java class, called a clientlet. We believe this solution is considerably superior to using a scripting language such as Javascript.
