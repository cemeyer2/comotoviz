The Warrior platform can currently 
<img src="test1.gif" align="left">be used (1) to deploy XAMJ apps over HTTP similarly to Java Webstart, (2) to launch standalone XAMJ apps, (3) as an XML UI API, and (4) as a browser for new content types, including other Java-based XML UI languages. 

XAMJ 
<img src="test1.gif" width="100" height="200" align="right">
allows embedding Java code in several types of scriptlets, much like JSP,<br>
except on the client side (with security restrictions.)<br>
That is, a XAMJ document is translated into a Java class, called a clientlet. We believe this solution is considerably superior to using a scripting language such as Javascript. 

There is no need to pre-compile or package XAMJ code. Testing your changes involves simply modifying the source code and running it, much like trying out changes to an HTML page. Additionally, we provide a way to link XAMJ apps from HTML which is similar to the way you link JAR files using JNLP, except we make it simple. (Our examples use that.)

XAMJ UI markup is a lot more compact than equivalent Swing or SWT code. XML UI languages in general are considered Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools for this very reason. 

XAMJ apps can also be standalone. In Windows you can simply double-click a .xamj file. Compilation is on-demand and cached, so it has the major benefits of an interpreted language, without being one. 

XAMJ documents (and clientlets in general) have access to a capability we call managed stores. These are small file systems with quota restrictions accessible securely by documents served over HTTP. 

A XAMJ app can link another app much the same way HTML pages link one another. For example, an app could have a Forum menu-item with an href attribute that launches a separate specialized app, potentially hosted by a third party. (Some of our examples link each other this way.) We don't expect different brandings to be as much of a concern as it is with HTML pages. 

To get a better idea of where XAMJ technology fits in relation to other client platforms, see the following table which breaks down how it compares in several key areas to two well-known technologies: (1) HTML/Javascript browsers, which are thin client platforms, and (2) Java Webstart, which is more of a thick client platform.
