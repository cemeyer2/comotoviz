1:29:26 PM Cinda: what's conrad.model? for example?
1:29:53 PM Alex Lambert: models are classes that are database-backed
1:30:07 PM Alex Lambert: code is svn now, svn co https://subversion.cs.uiuc.edu/svn/risc/ ~/svn
1:30:15 PM Cinda: k
1:30:42 PM Cinda: and aplconrad vs aplrisc?
1:30:47 PM Alex Lambert: don't remember
1:30:50 PM Cinda: i just basically can't tell what i'm looking atl.
1:30:52 PM Cinda: ok.
1:30:55 PM Cinda: i'll try to figure it out.
1:30:59 PM Alex Lambert: i removed a lot of the junk from the svn commit
1:31:02 PM Alex Lambert: so it might be easier to figure out
1:31:04 PM Cinda: k
1:31:11 PM Alex Lambert: i would start by reading ~/svn/conrad/conrad/model.py
1:31:12 PM Cinda: i'll just remove all this.
1:31:16 PM Alex Lambert: k
1:31:29 PM Alex Lambert: it defines the classes used elsewhere
1:31:35 PM Alex Lambert: e.g.
1:31:35 PM Alex Lambert: class User(elixir.Entity):
    name = elixir.Field(elixir.String(10), primary_key=True)
    password = elixir.Field(elixir.String(16))
    superuser = elixir.Field(elixir.Boolean())
    courses = elixir.ManyToMany('Course')

    def __repr__(self):
        return "<user %s>" % self.name

1:31:57 PM Alex Lambert: a user has a username, a password, a flag saying if she's a superuser, and zero or more courses she has access to
1:33:04 PM Cinda: k
1:33:12 PM Cinda: so that's part of the service infrastructure?
1:33:16 PM Alex Lambert: yep
1:33:24 PM Alex Lambert: no actual user auth/anything yet
1:33:42 PM Alex Lambert: but eventually :)
1:33:56 PM Alex Lambert: we can go through all the classes now if you like
1:35:23 PM Cinda: so, the model.py gives me the db schema
1:35:24 PM Cinda: ?
1:35:27 PM Alex Lambert: yep
1:36:08 PM Cinda: elixer is the kind of db
1:36:09 PM Cinda: ?
1:36:43 PM Alex Lambert: yep, elixir is the thing that lets us easily map python classes onto a sql database
1:36:47 PM Alex Lambert: so we get persistence
1:36:53 PM Cinda: k
1:37:08 PM Cinda: and sqlalchemy is the language used to pull the data from the db.
1:37:15 PM Cinda: (just a particular implementation of sql?)
1:38:05 PM Alex Lambert: sqlalchemy provides a nice implementation-agnostic way to talk to sql databaess from python (in this case, the sql database is 'sqlite'. other options include mysql and postgresql). elixir is a layer on top of that to make it easy to throw objects into a db
1:42:06 PM Cinda: you say the code is crap, but do you like the db schema?
1:42:09 PM Alex Lambert: yep
1:42:12 PM Cinda: did you think pretty carefully abt it?
1:42:18 PM Alex Lambert: yep, lts of revisions there
1:42:21 PM Cinda: k
1:42:29 PM Alex Lambert: jplag folks still ahvent approved my account
1:42:33 PM Alex Lambert: probably been a month
1:42:40 PM Cinda: should i send an email?
1:42:44 PM Alex Lambert: mailed one of the maintainers a bit ago
1:42:50 PM Alex Lambert: he's no longer w/ the univ but said he'd fwd it on
1:42:57 PM Alex Lambert: i'd assume it was a student project that's been abandoned
1:42:57 PM Cinda: what univ?
1:43:01 PM Alex Lambert: sent several other mails w/o rsp
1:43:02 PM Cinda: oh.
1:43:03 PM Cinda: :(
1:43:08 PM Alex Lambert: https://www.ipd.uni-karlsruhe.de/jplag/
1:43:15 PM Cinda: my first question is whether or not we should grab it...
1:43:51 PM Cinda: secure connection failed?
1:43:57 PM Alex Lambert: yeah dunno the cause, i just hit allow
1:45:31 PM Cinda: you contacted Tichy?
1:45:37 PM Alex Lambert: the prof? nope
1:46:04 PM Alex Lambert: oh, for the report class, i would remove the moss-specific and jplag-specific reports and just hvae that contain an aggregate report
1:46:18 PM Alex Lambert: and for the analysis stuff i'd remove the MossFile etc and just have those stored in the filesystem
1:46:27 PM Alex Lambert: but those are minor things i havent gotten around to touching
1:46:31 PM Alex Lambert: ill leave a note w/ charlie.
1:46:34 PM Cinda: larger pt is that you want to make it tool independent?
1:46:45 PM Alex Lambert: that is the deisgn atm
1:46:59 PM Cinda: ya, i saw
1:47:01 PM Alex Lambert: but i didnt  think it through enough and made it too much indep
1:47:05 PM Alex Lambert: so analysis can use multiple tools
1:47:13 PM Alex Lambert: but really the report should be one coherent report instead of a report-by-tool
1:47:17 PM Alex Lambert: so thats the fix to make there
1:47:20 PM Cinda: ok.
1:47:49 PM Alex Lambert: will ptu this log in svn as the intro
1:47:58 PM Cinda: k
1:49:58 PM Cinda: email sent to charlie.
1:50:02 PM Alex Lambert: just im'd him
1:50:03 PM Alex Lambert: hehe.
1:50:21 PM Cinda: i know i intended to do some post processing before i talked to the latest group of cheaters, but i can't remember what it was.
1:50:21 PM Cinda: erg.
1:51:06 PM Cinda: actually, maybe your design is better as is...
1:51:26 PM Cinda: into any report we'd like to be able to plug in results from any tool.  
1:51:39 PM Cinda: and it might be useful to know what tool the results came from.
1:51:40 PM Alex Lambert: so three stages
1:51:44 PM Alex Lambert: repository
1:51:49 PM Alex Lambert: analysis (moss, jplag)
1:51:50 PM Alex Lambert: reporting
1:52:07 PM Alex Lambert: reporting being graphics, lists of matches, etc
1:52:08 PM Alex Lambert: report creation has access to all of the analysis
1:52:10 PM Cinda: repository == populating the db?
1:52:13 PM Alex Lambert: yep
1:52:44 PM Cinda: nice breakdown.
1:53:08 PM Alex Lambert: so what i meant by that is there's no reason to generate reports from each tool in isolation -- whatever reporting is done has access to all of the tools' analyses (so, e.g., instead of generating a list of matches for jplag and another list for moss, it can generate one list combining the two)
1:53:41 PM Cinda: but different tools might have different reliability (for example) and in a report we might want to know from what tool a result emerged...
1:53:46 PM Cinda: but i see what you're saying too...
1:53:48 PM Alex Lambert: right
1:53:52 PM Alex Lambert: and tahts something reporting can do
1:53:57 PM Alex Lambert: because it has access to each tools' results
1:53:58 PM Cinda: our report should have its OWN reliability
1:54:01 PM Cinda: k
1:54:25 PM Alex Lambert: under other model -- each tool would be doing its own indep report
1:54:52 PM Cinda: so, how configurable should we allow reporting to be?
1:55:03 PM Cinda: i'm thinking not very...
1:55:09 PM Alex Lambert: not very -- but...
1:55:21 PM Alex Lambert: part of the "report" can be an easily-parsable (xml or whatnot) list of matches
1:55:35 PM Alex Lambert: so classes can run with that and do their own reporting later
1:55:37 PM Cinda: are you logging this conv?
1:55:43 PM Alex Lambert: yep
1:55:49 PM Cinda: oh, nm. i can still save.
1:55:50 PM Alex Lambert: told charlie i'd put it all in svn once we finished
1:55:59 PM Cinda: k
1:56:31 PM Cinda: let's talk repo for a minute...
1:56:42 PM Cinda: how much data are you imagining, if this is a service to dept?
1:56:50 PM Cinda: and if it's a svc to outside?
1:56:56 PM Cinda: (infrastructure question)
1:57:12 PM Alex Lambert: cs225 two semesters was 50MB
1:57:16 PM Cinda: :)
1:57:18 PM Cinda: nm.
1:57:20 PM Cinda: not an issue?
1:57:42 PM Alex Lambert: repo, nope. reports and analyses could get a bit larger but we don't need to store those long-term since they can be regerated at any time
1:57:49 PM Cinda: right.
1:58:00 PM Alex Lambert: (that's my reason for taking MossFile/etc out of the db)
1:59:03 PM Alex Lambert: so yeah, one little admin thing to do is to cull old reports/analyses every once in a while
2:00:24 PM Alex Lambert: also, to get it in the readme:
2:00:37 PM Alex Lambert: 

4:33:17 PM Alex Lambert: one issue we may run into
4:33:23 PM Alex Lambert: moss only reports 250 matches
4:33:48 PM Alex Lambert: not sure if cumulative matches over 3 semesters would drown out interesting hits in fa09
4:34:21 PM Cinda: why is it not 3 separate requests?
4:34:32 PM Cinda: no point in comparing spring09 w fall08, for example.
4:34:43 PM Alex Lambert: might do that to address it
4:34:52 PM Alex Lambert: will see how jplag addresses the issue (still waiting for access to it)
4:35:14 PM Cinda: i really will only be interested in the current semester,
4:35:26 PM Cinda: and the culling we intend to do will help a little.
4:35:34 PM Alex Lambert: nod
