for these scripts to run properly, must have the following dirs in this dir:

fa08 - containing one dir per netid with 1 dir per assignment with each assign dir having that assign's files
sp09 - """"
fa09 - """"
soln - containing one dir per assign containing all the soln files for that assign

import.py and moss.py are not tolerant of failure, so run them under screen to ensure they complete

report.py and r2.py are tolerant of failure and can be run multiple times for the same assign

to run a report:

you will have to manually modify (as of now) each of the scripts to run over the assignment you want, syntax should be self explanitory

run import.py to make sure the assign you want to run is in the db
run moss.py once to run moss analysis on the submissions
run report.py
run r2.py
